## Blood Pressure Estimation Using Symbolic Regression Analysis

Welcome to our GitHub repository where we explore innovative approaches to blood pressure estimation through regression analysis. This project aims to develop robust models that can predict blood pressure levels accurately using non-invasive methods.

### Project Overview
In this project, we apply various symbolic regression techniques to predict blood pressure from physiological signals. Our goal is to advance the field of medical diagnostics by providing a reliable tool for monitoring blood pressure that can be easily integrated into healthcare systems.

### Objectives
- To develop and validate symbolic regression models for accurate blood pressure estimation.
- To compare different symbolic regression and traditional techniques to find the most effective approach.
- To ensure our models are interpretable and can be utilized in clinical environments.

### Dataset
We utilize publicly available datasets consisting of physiological signals correlated with blood pressure measurements. These datasets include features like heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and other relevant parameters.

### Technologies
This project is implemented using Python, with libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, pyoperon for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib for visualization.


Thank you for visiting our project. We hope our work contributes positively to the field of medical technology and aids in the advancement of non-invasive diagnostic tools.
